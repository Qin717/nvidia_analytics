## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Follow these steps:

### Using HTTPS (Recommended for beginners)

```bash

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nvidia-patent-analytics.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Using SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/nvidia-patent-analytics

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/nvidia-patent-analytics.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see:
   - ✅ Beautiful README displayed on homepage

## 🔐 Authentication Issues?

### HTTPS: Use Personal Access Token

If you get authentication errors with HTTPS:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "NVIDIA Patent Analytics")
4. Select scopes: Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. When pushing, use the token as your password

### SSH: Set Up SSH Keys

For SSH authentication:

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Add SSH key to ssh-agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```
3. Copy SSH key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
4. Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
5. Paste your key and save

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nvidia-patent-analytics.git
```

### Error: "Permission denied"

- Make sure you have push access to the repository
- Check your authentication (HTTPS token or SSH key)
- Verify repository URL: `git remote -v`

### Change Remote URL

```bash
# View current remote
git remote -v

# Change from HTTPS to SSH (or vice versa)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/nvidia-patent-analytics.git
```
